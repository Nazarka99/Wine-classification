# Wine Classification

This is a machine learning project that uses classification algorithms to predict the type of wine based on its chemical properties. The data is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).

## Data

The data consists of 178 wine samples with 13 chemical properties and a target variable indicating the type of wine. The data is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).

## Models

We use several classification algorithms to train models on the data, including Support Vector Classification, Random Forest Classification, Neural Network Classification, XGBoost Classification, and Logistic Regression.

## Results

We evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy and mean squared error (MSE). The results show that ...

## Usage

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib
